[property]="expression" : set property of an element to the value of expression
(event)="statement" : execute statement when event occurred
[(property)]="expression" : create two-way binding with expression
[class.special]="expression" : add special CSS class to element when the value of expression is truthy
[style.color]="expression" : set color CSS property to the value of expression

<!--The expression context of a component is the component instance.
And the component instance is an instance of the component class.
Component class of our AppComponent is defined in app.component.ts-->
